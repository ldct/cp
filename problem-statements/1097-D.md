hello 2019

Makoto has a big blackboard with a positive integer 𝑛 written on it. He will perform the following action exactly 𝑘 times:

Suppose the number currently written on the blackboard is 𝑣. He will randomly pick one of the divisors of 𝑣 (possibly 1 and 𝑣) and replace 𝑣 with this divisor. As Makoto uses his famous random number generator (RNG) and as he always uses 58 as his generator seed, each divisor is guaranteed to be chosen with equal probability.

He now wonders what is the expected value of the number written on the blackboard after 𝑘 steps.

It can be shown that this value can be represented as 𝑃𝑄 where 𝑃 and 𝑄 are coprime integers and 𝑄≢0(mod109+7). Print the value of 𝑃⋅𝑄−1 modulo 109+7.

Input
The only line of the input contains two integers 𝑛 and 𝑘 (1≤𝑛≤1015, 1≤𝑘≤104).

Output
Print a single integer — the expected value of the number on the blackboard after 𝑘 steps as 𝑃⋅𝑄−1(mod109+7) for 𝑃, 𝑄 defined above.

Note
In the first example, after one step, the number written on the blackboard is 1, 2, 3 or 6 — each occurring with equal probability. Hence, the answer is 1+2+3+64=3.

In the second example, the answer is equal to 1⋅916+2⋅316+3⋅316+6⋅116=158.
